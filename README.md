## Description
This app is a Weather Dashboard that runs in the browser and features a dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The app uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve data for cities.

## Installation
Clone the repo and run the app in your browser. Alternatively, it can be used [here](https://mahlheim.github.io/fantastic-rotary-phone/).

## Usage
Navigate to the application [here](https://mahlheim.github.io/fantastic-rotary-phone/). Enter a city in the search bar on the left hand side of the page. Today's forecast will populate in the large top card and a 5 day forecast will populate below the large card. Enter a new city to see it's weather. Each city you enter will be saved in a list below the search bar and can be clicked on if you wish to see the data for that city again.
